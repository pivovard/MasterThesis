We investigate the behaviour of plasma glucose concentration predicted by the model given carbohydrate (CHO) inputs and commensurate insulin inputs. We observe that to maintain plasma glucose above a specified minimum concentration results in an unavoidable peak in plasma glucose. Additionally, we specify the timing and magnitude of a bolus pulse to minimise this unavoidable peak in plasma glucose concentration whilst attaining but not going below the desired minimum glucose concentration. Finally, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the glucose concentration to be minimised.}

Meal announcements are manual feedforward inputs. We have developed a meal-detection and meal bolusing algorithm based on continuous glucose measurements without manual information from patients. Bergman's minimal model is modified and used in an unscented Kalman filter for state estimations. The estimated rate of appearance of glucose is used for meal detection and calculation of meal boluses. The algorithm is tested in simulation and clinical environments. The proposed algorithm decreases the frequency, duration and magnitude of hyperglycemia without causing any additional hypoglycemia.}

 ABSTRACT = {The artificial pancreas (AP) system is designed to regulate blood glucose in subjects with type 1 diabetes using a continuous glucose monitor informed controller that adjusts insulin infusion via an insulin pump. However, current AP developments are mainly hybrid closed-loop systems that include feed-forward actions triggered by the announcement of meals or exercise. The first step to fully closing the loop in the AP requires removing meal announcement, which is currently the most effective way to alleviate postprandial hyperglycemia due to the delay in insulin action. Here, a novel approach to meal detection in the AP is presented using a sliding window and computing the normalized cross-covariance between measured glucose and the forward difference of a disturbance term, estimated from an augmented minimal model using an Unscented Kalman Filter. Three different tunings were applied to the same meal detection algorithm: (1) a high sensitivity tuning, (2) a trade-off tuning that has a high amount of meals detected and a low amount of false positives (FP), and (3) a low FP tuning. For the three tunings sensitivities 99 ± 2%, 93 ± 5%, and 47 ± 12% were achieved, respectively. A sensitivity analysis was also performed and found that higher carbohydrate quantities and faster rates of glucose appearance result in favorable meal detection outcomes.},

abstract = {Diabetic patient desires to avoid hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes, which result from insufficient insulin production. As the diabetes disease progresses, it requires an advance control of external insulin administration with an insulin pump. Given the importance of blood-glucose level prediction for the insulin therapy, there is a Blood-Glucose Level Prediction Challenge. This prediction is based on a post-mortem dataset, which include a number of signals related to the daily life of a diabetic patient. We propose replacing these post-mortem signals with an in-silico diabetic patient. For this purpose, we can use the SmartCGMS continuous glucose monitoring and controlling framework together with an FDA-accepted diabetic patient simulation. As a result, a competing researcher have the same conditions as a developer of a real-life insulin pump, connected to a real diabetic patient. When using SmartCGMS, simulated, prototyped and real devices can work together. This approach reduces the difference between laboratory and practical results, thus increasing the level of realism for the entire challenge. As a report on the current SmartCGMS state, we describe the previously unpublished features, which enable an improved glucose level prediction and/or control challenge.}

abstract = {Diabetes is a widespread civilization disease. It manifests with an elevated blood glucose level. In the long-term, elevated blood glucose level continuously damages organs. In the short-term, hypo- and hyperglycemia are acute complications. Insulin lowers blood glucose level by promoting its utilization. At basal rate, insulin pump delivers insulin to subcutaneous tissue to control blood glucose level. In addition, patient doses insulin boluses in accordance with estimated carbohydrate content of consumed meal. Control algorithm of the pump considers the boluses, when calculating the basal rate. In our previous work, we have proposed a parallel-architecture for the next-generation of glucose monitoring - SmartCGMS. It unifies the source-code base and the glucose-monitoring-and-control paradigm across real, simulated and prototyped devices. As the development continues, especially towards the pump-control algorithms, we face a problem of reducing the SmartCGMS requirements when considering a low-power hardware. In this paper, we present the modifications that lead to a reduced number of threads, while implementing the closed-loop feedback between a glucose sensor and insulin pump to conduct FDA accepted in-silico pre-clinical trials.}

By introducing gate functions into the cell structure, the long short-term memory (LSTM) could handle the problem of long-term dependencies well. Since its introduction, almost all the exciting results based on RNNs have been achieved by the LSTM. The LSTM has become the focus of deep learning. We review the LSTM cell and its variants to explore the learning capacity of the LSTM cell. Furthermore, the LSTM networks are divided into two broad categories: LSTM-dominated networks and integrated LSTM networks. In addition, their various applications are discussed.
