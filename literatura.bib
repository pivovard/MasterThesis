abstract = {The Bergman minimal model is a dynamic model of plasma glucose concentration. It has two input variables - insulin delivery and carbohydrate intake. We investigate the behaviour of plasma glucose concentration predicted by the model given carbohydrate (CHO) inputs and commensurate insulin inputs. We observe that to maintain plasma glucose above a specified minimum concentration results in an unavoidable peak in plasma glucose. Additionally, we specify the timing and magnitude of a bolus pulse to minimise this unavoidable peak in plasma glucose concentration whilst attaining but not going below the desired minimum glucose concentration. Finally, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the glucose concentration to be minimised.}

 abstract = {Post-prandial hyperglycemia can occur more frequently in artificial pancreas systems without meal announcements that trigger insulin boluses. Meal announcements are manual feedforward inputs. We have developed a meal-detection and meal bolusing algorithm based on continuous glucose measurements without manual information from patients. Bergman's minimal model is modified and used in an unscented Kalman filter for state estimations. The estimated rate of appearance of glucose is used for meal detection and calculation of meal boluses. The algorithm is tested in simulation and clinical environments. The proposed algorithm decreases the frequency, duration and magnitude of hyperglycemia without causing any additional hypoglycemia.}

 ABSTRACT = {The artificial pancreas (AP) system is designed to regulate blood glucose in subjects with type 1 diabetes using a continuous glucose monitor informed controller that adjusts insulin infusion via an insulin pump. However, current AP developments are mainly hybrid closed-loop systems that include feed-forward actions triggered by the announcement of meals or exercise. The first step to fully closing the loop in the AP requires removing meal announcement, which is currently the most effective way to alleviate postprandial hyperglycemia due to the delay in insulin action. Here, a novel approach to meal detection in the AP is presented using a sliding window and computing the normalized cross-covariance between measured glucose and the forward difference of a disturbance term, estimated from an augmented minimal model using an Unscented Kalman Filter. Three different tunings were applied to the same meal detection algorithm: (1) a high sensitivity tuning, (2) a trade-off tuning that has a high amount of meals detected and a low amount of false positives (FP), and (3) a low FP tuning. For the three tunings sensitivities 99 ± 2%, 93 ± 5%, and 47 ± 12% were achieved, respectively. A sensitivity analysis was also performed and found that higher carbohydrate quantities and faster rates of glucose appearance result in favorable meal detection outcomes.},
